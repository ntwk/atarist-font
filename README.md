## Overview

Atarist is a rebranding of the high-resolution system font originally
featured on the Atari ST home computer.  It is a monospaced bitmap
font available in a single size of 8x16 pixels.

## Installation

1. If you would prefer a PCF format font, run `make`.
2. Copy or symlink the font to your ~/.fonts directory:
   `cp atarist-normal.bdf ~/.fonts`
3. Run `fc-cache -fv` to update your font cache.
